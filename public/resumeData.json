    "bio":"I taught French as a foreign language to beginner, intermediate, and advanced students of various cultural and linguistic backgrounds in British international school of Kiev for one year. Through my teaching experiences and studies, I developed critical pedagogic and classroom management skills, along with a passion for teaching French.\nI'm equipped with the Communicative Teaching Method. I apply this method in the classroom through interactive, student-centered activities that maximize “student talk time.” I scaffold my lessons so that they include pair and group work, as well as movement around the classroom. By engaging students in speaking, grammar, writing, listening, and reading and appealing to diverse learning styles, I help them improve their accuracy and fluency across key skill areas.\nSince 2012 I have prepared students to pass the exams DELF A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 and TEFaQ for immigration to Canada in association with Alliance française.",
